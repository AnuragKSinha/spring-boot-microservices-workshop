# Goals
1. __Externalization:__ So that there is no need to restart the system
2. __Environment Specific:__ As diff diff env will have diff diff configurations 
3. __Consistent:__ As there are multiple instances of Microservice then its Important that same configuration is present in all the instances
4. __Version History:__ As its externalized so it not part of the code base so having a verion history is important
5. __Real Time management:__ the configuration should be picked up in real time and there should not be any need for server restart
