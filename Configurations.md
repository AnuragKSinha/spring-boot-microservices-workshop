# Goals
1. Externalization: So that there is no need to restart the system
2. Environment Specific: As diff diff env will have diff diff configurations 
3. Consistent: As there are multiple instances of Microservice then its Important that same configuration is present in all the instances
4. Version History: As its externalized so it not part of the code base so having a verion history is important
5. Real Time management: the configuration should be picked up in real time and there should not be any need for server restart
